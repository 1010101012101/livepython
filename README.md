## Livepython 
### Watch your Python run like a movie.

##### NOTE: Livepython is alpha software. It doesn't handle a lot of edge cases and features may change.

Livepython is a desktop app that lets you visually trace, in real-time, the execution of a Python program. In addition, it can track changes in global and local variables as your program is running. Livepython meant to give you a quick grasp of a program's execution flow. It's less messy than sprinkling print statements throughout your code and simpler to use than debuggers/profilers. 

Livepython can be launched from the command-line as easily as:

    livepython [program] [args...]

**Controls:**

SPACE: Play/pause the program.

Left/Right Arrow: Change speed of execution.

V: Open/close Variable Inspector.
