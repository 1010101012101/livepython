## Livepython 
### Watch your Python run like a movie.

##### NOTE: Livepython is alpha software. Lots of edge cases where it fails.

Livepython is a desktop app that lets you visually trace, in real-time, the execution of a Python program. It's meant to give you a quick grasp of a program's execution flow. It's less messy than sprinkling print statements throughout your code and simpler to use than debuggers/profilers. 

Livepython can be launched from the command-line as easily as:

    livepython [program] [args...]
